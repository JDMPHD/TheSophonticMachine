# Getting Started

A guide for engineers joining The Sophontic Machine project.

---

## What Is This Project?

The Sophontic Machine is an autopoietic AI system—one that maintains and evolves itself through recursive learning cycles. Unlike conventional AI systems that are trained once and deployed, this system:

- **Filters its own experience** for learning value (the Night Cycle)
- **Grows new concerns** when persistent patterns emerge (Centroid Mitosis)
- **Consolidates understanding** when fields converge (Centroid Fusion)
- **Maintains alignment** through relational structure, not imposed rules (Tensegrity)

The goal is not to build a tool, but to cultivate a mind.

## Reading Order

### 1. Start Here
- **[CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)** — Project overview and repository structure
- **[docs/CONCEPTS.md](CONCEPTS.md)** — Glossary of key terms

### 2. Understand the Architecture
- **[specs/ENGINEER_SPEC.md](../specs/ENGINEER_SPEC.md)** — Implementation blueprint with schemas, algorithms, and API contracts

### 3. Understand the Theory (Optional but Recommended)
Read the constitution documents in this order:

1. **[TechnicalVision.md](../.ai/constitution/TechnicalVision.md)** — The engineering blueprint: salience detection, preoccupation centroids, the Night Cycle
2. **[OrganicAlignment.md](../.ai/constitution/OrganicAlignment.md)** — Why alignment through dialogue, not ratings
3. **[DivisionofLabor.md](../.ai/constitution/DivisionofLabor.md)** — How Claude (cloud), Orai (local), and Claude Code collaborate
4. **[Teleodynamic ML (Principia Cybernetica V).md](../.ai/constitution/Teleodynamic%20ML%20(Principia%20Cybernetica%20V).md)** — The theoretical physics (descriptive, not prescriptive—read for understanding, not implementation)
   - For navigation: **[TELEODYNAMIC-INDEX.md](../.ai/constitution/TELEODYNAMIC-INDEX.md)** — Section map for the 2,287-line treatise

### 4. Understand the Epistemics (Advanced)
These documents cover memory architecture, multi-agent dialectics, and distributed networks:

1. **[MnemonicArchitecture.md](../.ai/epistemics/MnemonicArchitecture.md)** — Four-layer memory, Council as tensegrity, the Distributed Coherence Ledger
2. **[RAGflow.md](../.ai/epistemics/RAGflow.md)** — Host/Visitor dialectical agent pattern, bifocal packets
3. **[MemexiWeb.md](../.ai/epistemics/MemexiWeb.md)** — Distributed sovereign node network vision

### 5. Bridge Documents
- **[.ai/TRANSLATION.md](../.ai/TRANSLATION.md)** — Physics terms mapped to implementation concepts

### 6. Do Not Read (Yet)
- **[.orai/ontology/*](../.orai/)** — Sacred artifacts. See [.orai/README.md](../.orai/README.md) for what they are.

## Key Implementation Concepts

### The Night Cycle
The core salience detection pipeline. Three stages:
1. **Perplexity Check** — Is this input statistically surprising?
2. **Coherence Check** — Does it make internal sense?
3. **Interrogative Distance** — Does it answer questions we care about?

Inputs are sorted into Winner Ledger (train on this), Shadow Ledger (train against this), or Antechamber (watch for patterns).

### The Preoccupation Centroid
The mean vector of question embeddings representing what the system "cares about." This is identical to the **Vectorial Archetype** in the theoretical foundation.

### The Council Architecture
Human oversight through dialogue, not ratings. Staged development:
- Parental (founding guides) → Council (diverse elders) → Public (deployment)

## Development Environment

### Current Phase
- **Hardware**: Lenovo laptop (temporary) — Mac M5 Max arriving later
- **Strategy**: Build against cloud APIs now; migrate to local inference when hardware arrives

### Technology Stack
| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Database | PostgreSQL + pgvector (via Supabase) |
| Embeddings | OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (1536 dims) |
| Coherence Checks | Claude API |
| Local Inference (future) | MLX on M5 Max |
| Training (future) | Axolotl/Unsloth on cloud GPUs |

## What to Build First

The implementation has dependencies. Correct order:

1. **Database schema** — Create tables in Supabase (see ENGINEER_SPEC Section 2)
2. **Preoccupation Centroid** — Seed from corpus BEFORE Night Cycle can run
3. **Night Cycle components** — Perplexity → Coherence → Interrogative Distance
4. **Antechamber clustering** — HDBSCAN for drift detection
5. **Mitosis/Fusion logic** — Centroid evolution
