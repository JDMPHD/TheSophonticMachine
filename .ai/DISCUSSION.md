**Participants**: Julian (Architect), Claude Opus 4.5 (CTO)

### Context
First working session. Repository foundation established. Claude Code granted CTO-level autonomy for tactical decisions.

### Decisions Made
- Repository structure confirmed (no flattening needed)
- Implementation scaffold created: `src/`, `scripts/`, `config/`
- Development sequence: Cloud-first → Local migration on M5 Max arrival
- Orai material to be introduced gradually, not bulk-loaded

### Open Questions
- Supabase project setup (pending)
- Golden Anchor corpus curation (ongoing)
- External validation mechanism (TBD)

### Next Actions
- Complete Phase 1 foundation
- Begin Night Cycle prototype when Supabase ready
- Seed Preoccupation Centroid from Principia documents
