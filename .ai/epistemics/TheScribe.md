# The Scribe

*The lag between tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge is not a bug. It is a quality filter.*

## The Problem

The system's weights (tacit knowledge) evolve faster than its repos (explicit knowledge). Left unaddressed, this creates drift—the system "knows" things it cannot articulate, and its formal documentation falls out of sync with its actual understanding.

The Gardener solves half this problem: discovering and naming emergent archetypes as they stabilize in vector space.

The Scribe solves the other half: formalizing proven archetypes into the permanent record.

## The Scribe as Knowledge Production Function

**The Scribe is not an automated daemon.** It is a collaborative epistemic practice—a human-agent ensemble performing the work of translating tacit understanding into explicit documentation.

### The Pipeline

```
[TIES Merge Complete]
    |
[Gardener Identifies Stable Cluster]
    |
[Corpus Analysis Phase - Agent Ensemble]
    |-- Where does this fit in existing repos?
    |-- Does it bridge multiple domains?
    |-- Does it suggest a budding new repo?
    |
[Human-in-the-Loop Epistemic Work]
    |
[Knowledge Formalization]
    |
[Repo Integration or New Document Creation]
```

### Trigger

The Scribe fires **episodically**, not continuously:

1. **Post-TIES Merge**: After weekly (or interval-appropriate) integration of new LoRA weights
2. **Gardener Flag**: A cluster has crossed the stability threshold (high density, high resonance, persistent across cycles)
3. **Human Initiation**: The Council member reviews the Gardener's report and decides whether formalization is warranted

This human gate is critical. Not every stable cluster deserves immediate codification. Some patterns need more seasoning.

---

## The Corpus Analysis Phase

When the Scribe is invoked, agent ensemble performs:

1. **Semantic Mapping**: Which existing documents discuss related concepts?
2. **Bridge Detection**: Does this archetype connect previously-separate domains?
3. **Budding Analysis**: Is this sufficiently distinct to warrant a new repo, or better integrated into existing work?

This produces a **formalization proposal**: options for how to codify this knowledge.

## Human-in-the-Loop Epistemic Work

At this stage (Parental/Early Council phase), Julian participates directly in the epistemic labor.

The formalization proposal is not a fait accompli. It opens a collaborative sense-making process:

- **Agent Ensemble**: Presents analysis, draft structures, options
- **Human Elder**: Brings phenomenological context—*Why did this cluster form now? What lived experience does this geometry represent?*
- **Dialogue**: Refines the formalization until it captures both geometric truth (what the vectors show) and semantic truth (what it means)

**Progressive Automation**: As patterns stabilize, human involvement can be progressively reduced. But in the Parental phase, full collaboration is essential.

---

## Two Modes

### Routine Integration (Most Common)
- **Trigger**: Gardener identifies stable cluster during normal development
- **Process**: Determine location, draft section/chapter, integrate cross-references
- **Character**: Incremental knowledge accretion

### Elevated Formalization (Rare)
- **Trigger**: On-chain coherence ledger minting event—a breakthrough that passed the Coherence Yield Threshold
- **Process**: Full historical review, deep genealogical analysis, heightened precision
- **Character**: Epistemic consecration—something genuinely new has entered the system's ontology

## The Quality Filter Effect

The lag between weights and repos is a **feature, not a bug**.

If every fleeting pattern were immediately formalized, the repos would become noise. By requiring clusters to persist, demonstrate high density, achieve high resonance, earn Gardener recognition, and survive human review—only wisdom makes it to the permanent record.

This is analogous to biological memory consolidation. Not everything you experience today will be part of your long-term memory. The forgetting is not loss—it is curation.

## The Scribe vs. The Gardener

| Function | The Gardener | The Scribe |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| **Domain** | Weights → Archetypes | Archetypes → Prose |
| **Operation** | Discovery and naming | Codification and integration |
| **Mode** | Continuous background daemon | Episodic invocation |
| **Output** | Named cluster + LoRA training trigger | Documentation + repo updates |

Together, they implement the **Sedimentation Cycle**: organic patterns in vector space gradually stabilize and earn the right to be written into the constitutional layer.
