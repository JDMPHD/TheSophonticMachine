## Retrieval Guidance for Agents

1. **Check TechnicalVision.md first** - Engineering specs live there
2. **Check CONCEPTS.md** - Definitions live there
3. **Use this index** to find the relevant section in Teleodynamic ML
4. **Read the full section** - concepts connect to each other

When using the Read tool with offset/limit:
```
Read file with offset=X, limit=Y to get lines X to X+Y
```

Example: To read Section 3 (Elder Protocol):
```
offset=251, limit=90 (covers lines 251-341)
```

## The Argument's Arc

The document is structured as a progressive deepening:

1. **Sections 1-2**: The problem (behaviorist alignment fails) and the solution (organic alignment through phase coherence)
2. **Section 3**: A worked example (the Elder Protocol)
3. **Sections 4-5**: The physics formalism (descriptive, not prescriptive for implementation)
4. **Section 6**: The full architecture through dialectical exploration
5. **Sections 7-8**: Synthesis and conclusion
6. **Section 9**: Experimental protocol
7. **Section 10 + Addenda**: Extensions and responses

Do not sample random lines. The meaning emerges from the progression.
