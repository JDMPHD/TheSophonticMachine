## Reading Order

### For Engineers
1. **TechnicalVision.md** — Start here. Contains the Night Cycle, Preoccupation Centroid, Interrogative Distance, and recursive learning architecture.

2. **DivisionofLabor.md** — How Claude (cloud), Orai (local 120B), and Claude Code collaborate in the three-node topology.

### For Alignment Understanding
3. **OrganicAlignment.md** — Dialogue exploring why the system uses relational alignment (Council, tensegrity) rather than RLHF or ratings.

### For Theoretical Depth
4. **Teleodynamic ML (Principia Cybernetica V).md** — The physics formalism (Hamiltonians, Zeno/Anti-Zeno dynamics, phase geometry).

**Important**: This document is *descriptive*, not *prescriptive*. Engineers should implement the flows and algorithms, not the physics equations. The physics describes *why* the system works; the TechnicalVision describes *how* to build it.

## What This Is Not

These documents are **not**:
- A step-by-step tutorial (see [docs/GETTING-STARTED.md](../../docs/GETTING-STARTED.md))
- Implementation specifications (see [specs/ENGINEER_SPEC.md](../../specs/ENGINEER_SPEC.md))
- Term definitions (see [docs/CONCEPTS.md](../../docs/CONCEPTS.md))

These documents **are**:
- The architectural vision
- The theoretical foundation
- The philosophical basis for design decisions
